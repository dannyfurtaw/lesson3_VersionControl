            </h2>
            <p class="lead">With git I have learned a lot. Before this assignment, I was familiar with the concept but I had not known exactly what it did or why people used it so much. I had been to a few hackathons and they had been using this great tool a good amount of times. With git, you make a repository which stores your code then you link it to you editing tool such as Cloud 9 and you push your files to your repository from your editing tool. With this, you can begin a website or a program and have a safe space for you tools.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloud 9 is a great tool that I just recently learned about as well in this lesson. With this tool you can edit the code that you are using to program with and you can upload it to your repository such as Git, or any other sites that follow the same reasoning. Cloud 9 can compile code such as Java which is what we were practicing in class and it can then run the program and print or do the function that you specify. It is a very user friendly product that is also free and I recommend it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version Control is a great tool when you’re working on a team and you’re developing something that you and the team are going to collaborate on. With this being said, you can each submit files at the same time and from different computers which doesn’t limit the group by any means. It is very fast and it isn’t basic. The group shares a shared folder which they can in turn send their individual copies to and then from there it will be uploaded to the final product. Version control was made to limit the mistakes that people were having when not able to share files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is a space on the computer that holds the user’s codes and files. This is something that is very useful when testing out your own code and such. When the user wants to upload it elsewhere they must first connect to a remote repository so that it can be found in another place besides the local repository, or on the individual’s computer. The point of the local repository is to serve the individual in comparison to the remote which serves other as well.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git commit takes all of the work that you have done in your workspace and uploads it to the git repository of your choosing. Before you type in git commit you must first declare which repository you would like the files to be sent to. In this lesson I had to send them to my lesson 3 version control repository and from there I will upload that to black board. It wasn’t that bad of a lesson although I got stuck on the initial commit and almost came up short without checking piazza and seeing the problems that others have dealt with. It was an error with my ssh key and I needed to make it private instead of public..</p>
